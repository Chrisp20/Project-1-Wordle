# Project-1-Wordle
As a part of my first week assignment within the codepath IOS dev course, I successfully completed a wordle program using the swift program.
# Project 1 - Wordle Application 2023

Submitted by: Christopher Petit

A play on the popular software Wordle is an app that allows user to input and delete character from a randomized list of names. If the user is correct green will be visible, yellow would be visible if letter is correct but not in right location, and black if the letter is in the incorrect location.

Time spent: 15 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X ] App displays a keyboard on the screen
- [X ] When tapping on the keyboard, a letter is shown or deleted (letter selected)
- [ X] User can play a basic version of Wordle, with different goal words each time

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
      I did not attempt the Stretch Feature, that would have surely improved the app quality.

## Video Walkthrough

-in the video I run a demo of my wordle app. The word that was eventually found was 'Wings' and the incorporation of yellow, green, and black was present in the video. The second video will incorporate the use of the delete button also as it was absent in the first one.


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
There are a handful of challenges when completing the program. I do not think there was one exercise that I did not require a little of assistance on. I personally do not believe I was ready for this assignment but I did not give up even though I was confused throughout I used my resources, such as TAs, Office hours, and online videos to help guide me through this project.
