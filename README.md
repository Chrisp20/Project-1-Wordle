# UNIT 2 - Wordle Part 2 (settings)

Submitted by: Christopher Petit

Wordle is an app that allows the user the ability to guess a word. This assignment is the second part of a previous assignment 
where the user will be able to change the settings. They can change the number of letters per row, numbers of rows on the board,
select a theme (animal, normal, locations) and select 'alien wordle' which can be turned on or off which would completely change the goal word
after a failed guess in the current row.

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X ] User can change the number of letters per row (the length of the goal word)
- [X ] User can change the numbers of rows on the board (how many guesses allowed)
- [X ] User can select a new themed set to pull the goal word from
- [X ] User can select "alien wordle", causing the goal word to change after each guess

## Notes

I had a problem with exercise 4 as I could not seem to get the alien function working and thought that I needed to use 
the currRow function but with help from a TA I was able to fix the alien function and it worked successful in a test run.
